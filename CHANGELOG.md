## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `include_contradicted` default flipped to `False`** (#69) — `list_decisions`, `fts_search_decisions`, `hybrid_search_decisions`, `ec_decision_search` MCP tool, and `ec decision search` CLI now exclude contradicted decisions by default. Pass `include_contradicted=True` (or `--include-contradicted` from the CLI) to restore the previous behavior. The `ec_decision_list` MCP tool also gains a new `include_contradicted` parameter (default `False`).

### Added

- **Retrieval telemetry completeness** (#70) — PostToolUse and SessionStart hooks now record per-decision `retrieval_selections` rows alongside the existing `retrieval_events` row, threading `selection_id` into Markdown fallback files. `record_retrieval_event` and `record_retrieval_selection` in `core/telemetry.py` accept a `commit` parameter (default `True`) so hook callers can defer commits for atomicity.
- **Extraction noise gate and confidence threshold** (#71) — `maybe_extract_decisions` now checks session quality before launching the extraction worker: sessions must have at least 1 checkpoint OR a configurable minimum number of turns with `files_touched` (`decisions.noise_gate_min_turns_with_files`, default 3). Additionally, `run_extraction` filters candidates below `decisions.candidate_min_confidence` (raised from 0.0 to 0.35) before persistence, preventing low-quality session-source candidates with no rationale or alternatives from entering the candidate pipeline.
- **Contract-sync drift guards** — `tests/test_contract_sync.py` asserts `mcp/server.__all__` matches what `register_tools()` actually registers (driven by AST extraction of `server.py`'s module tuple, not a hardcoded copy), that every `ec_*` tool is present in the README `### Available Tools` section bidirectionally (catches stale rows as well as missing rows), that `decision_hooks` fallback filename constants are documented in README, and that the current `SCHEMA_VERSION` is cross-referenced in a CHANGELOG paragraph that also mentions "schema". Replaces `tests/test_mcp_registration.py`, whose hardcoded expected set had silently drifted (its registration loop omitted `tools.decision_candidates` and its expected set omitted the four candidate tools, so it passed via symmetric drift — the exact failure mode the v0.2.0 retrospective finding #2 named).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-15

v0.2.0 narrows EntireContext around proactive decision memory for coding agents: past decisions surface automatically from current-change signals, staleness and contradictions no longer dominate retrieval, and new captures can enter via a reviewable candidate pipeline.

Database schema v11 → v13. v0.1.x databases auto-migrate on first `RepoContext` connection via `check_and_migrate`: v12 adds `decisions.auto_promotion_reset_at`, v13 adds the `decision_candidates` table (plus FTS5 mirror and triggers). Both migrations are additive — no data rewrite.

### Added

- **Proactive decision retrieval** (#42) — new `ec_decision_context` MCP tool assembles signals from the current session (recent turns' files, uncommitted git diff, latest checkpoint SHA) and returns ranked decisions in a single call. Each result includes a `selection_id` agents can pass directly to `ec_decision_outcome`/`ec_context_apply`. The tool degrades gracefully when there is no active session, falling back to git-diff-only signals with `signal_summary.active_session=false`.
- **Mid-session surfacing hook** (#42) — new PostToolUse hook `on_post_tool_use_decisions` surfaces decisions linked to just-edited files. Writes Markdown to `.entirecontext/decisions-context-tooluse-<session>.md` (session-qualified so concurrent sessions in the same repo cannot clobber each other) and also prints to stdout. SessionStart writes its own separate file `.entirecontext/decisions-context.md`. Gated by `decisions.surface_on_tool_use` (default off), with per-turn and session-wide deduplication and rate limiting via `decisions.surface_on_tool_use_turn_interval`. Session-start surfacing now populates the shared dedup set so decisions shown at session start are not re-surfaced mid-session.
- **Signal-based decision ranking** (#40) — `rank_related_decisions` replaces the 200-row recency scan with a candidate-first architecture that unions signals from files, assessments, diff FTS, and commit SHAs, scoring with five weighted signals plus a staleness penalty. Results include a `score_breakdown` for observability, and `ec_decision_related` accepts a new `commit_shas` parameter.
- **Candidate decision extraction pipeline** (#41) — new `decision_candidates` table (schema v13) collects drafts from sessions, checkpoints, and assessments, scores them with a reproducible confidence heuristic, dedupes via FTS5 similarity, and exposes a confirmation flow through `ec decision candidates list/show/confirm/reject` and the `ec_decision_candidate_*` MCP tools. Confirmation is atomic via claim-then-promote so concurrent CLI/MCP confirms cannot create duplicate decision rows, and turn-window derivation uses SQLite-normalized timestamps so same-day checkpoint bundles are never silently dropped. Gated by `[decisions] auto_extract` (default off).
- **Decision keyword search** (#45) — new `ec_decision_search` MCP tool, `ec decision search` CLI command, and `fts_search_decisions`/`hybrid_search_decisions` core APIs wire the existing `fts_decisions` FTS5 table into keyword and hybrid-RRF search with cross-repo ranking and search telemetry.
- **New flags on decision search and retrieval** (#39) — FTS and hybrid decision search accept `include_stale`, `include_superseded`, and `include_contradicted`. `get_decision` surfaces an immediate `successor` pointer when the decision is superseded. New CLI command `ec decision chain <id>` walks the supersession chain for debugging.
- **Auto-promotion from outcome feedback** (#39) — `record_decision_outcome` runs inside a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction and auto-promotes `staleness_status` to `contradicted` when a decision accumulates ≥2 contradicted outcomes that outnumber accepted outcomes. One-way ratchet — recovery requires manual `ec decision stale --status fresh`, which also resets the auto-promotion baseline. Threshold configurable via `[decisions] auto_promotion_contradicted_threshold`.
- **Supersession cycle detection** (#39) — `supersede_decision` walks the target's chain before writing and rejects inputs that would create a multi-hop cycle. `resolve_successor_chain` is also defended by a depth cap.

### Changed

- **Staleness filtering default behavior** (#39) — `rank_related_decisions` now hard-filters superseded and contradicted decisions by default and collapses supersession chains to their terminal successor. Fallback padding respects the same policy, and the session-start hook uses a single batched query applying the same central filter. Pre-v0.2.0 callers that relied on the prior lenient default should opt in to `include_stale`/`include_superseded`/`include_contradicted` as needed.
- **Product positioning and docs** (#38) — README now leads with decision memory as the wedge, reorganizes "How Decision Memory Works" above the capability list, splits Key Capabilities into core (decision memory) and supporting, and promotes decision tools to the top of the MCP tool table. AGENTS.md template extracted into a standalone doc. Lesson retrieval added as a sibling to decision reuse in agent instruction templates.

### Deprecated

- ~~**`include_contradicted` default**~~ — completed in [Unreleased]: default flipped to `False`.

### Fixed

- **MCP input normalization and query errors** (#44) — MCP tool `repos` parameters accept `str | list[str] | None` (scalar strings coerced to single-item lists); `ec_decision_create` coerces scalar `rejected_alternatives`/`supporting_evidence` to lists; FTS5 syntax errors return actionable JSON error payloads instead of opaque failures. The `repos=["*"]` wildcard contract is preserved.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **SQLite ResourceWarnings** — added context manager protocol to `RepoContext`/`GlobalContext`, converted all CLI and hook callers to guaranteed cleanup via `with` statements or `try/finally`

### Changed

- **Release workflow** — publish now gated on lint + test jobs; added install smoke test (`ec --help`) before artifact upload
- **Package metadata** — added PyPI classifiers (Alpha, MIT, Python 3.12/3.13, Typed) and project URLs (Homepage, Repository, Issues, Changelog)
- **Release artifacts** — LICENSE and CHANGELOG.md now explicitly included in sdist via `source-include`
