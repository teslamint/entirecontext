## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **SQLite ResourceWarnings** — added context manager protocol to `RepoContext`/`GlobalContext`, converted all CLI and hook callers to guaranteed cleanup via `with` statements or `try/finally`

### Changed

- **Release workflow** — publish now gated on lint + test jobs; added install smoke test (`ec --help`) before artifact upload
- **Package metadata** — added PyPI classifiers (Alpha, MIT, Python 3.12/3.13, Typed) and project URLs (Homepage, Repository, Issues, Changelog)
- **Release artifacts** — LICENSE and CHANGELOG.md now explicitly included in sdist via `source-include`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-09

Initial release of EntireContext: git-anchored decision memory for coding agents.

### Added

- **Core capture loop** — sessions, turns, tool calls, and checkpoints recorded through Claude Code hooks and anchored to git history
- **Decision model** — first-class decision records with outcome tracking, quality scoring, staleness detection, supersede/unlink, and FTS search
- **Decision hooks** — automatic extraction (`maybe_extract_decisions`), stale check (`maybe_check_stale_decisions`), and session-start context surfacing (`on_session_start_decisions`)
- **Assessments & feedback** — futures assessments, typed relationships, feedback loops, lessons, and trend analysis
- **Search** — regex, FTS5, semantic (sentence-transformers), and hybrid search across sessions and repos
- **AST index** — symbol-level search via tree-sitter integration
- **Knowledge graph** — entity and relationship graph with traversal and visualization
- **Git time-travel** — checkpoints, rewind, blame, and historical inspection
- **MCP server** — 20+ tools for in-session retrieval (search, checkpoints, assessments, graph, trends, decisions, dashboard)
- **Sync** — shadow branch export/import for cross-machine and cross-repo memory sharing
- **CLI** — comprehensive Typer-based CLI (`ec`) with subcommands for all features
- **Dashboard** — project health and activity overview
- **Cross-repo support** — per-repo local DB + global DB for broader learning patterns
- **Hook system** — 5 hook types (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, PostToolUse, SessionEnd) with stdin JSON protocol
- **Config** — TOML deep merge (defaults, global, per-repo) with security filtering and query redaction
- **Async workers** — background task execution for non-blocking hook operations

### Infrastructure

- Python 3.12+, uv build system
- SQLite with WAL mode, schema version 6
- FTS5 virtual tables with auto-sync triggers
- Hybrid storage: SQLite metadata + JSONL content files
